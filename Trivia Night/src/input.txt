The CIA Triad:the three principles of security control and management:Confidentiality; Integrity; Availability
Confidentiality:The fundamental security goal of keeping information and communications private and protecting them from unauthorized access:"Authorization is required for access!"
Integrity:The fundamental security goal of keeping organizational information accurate, free of errors, and without unauthorized modifications:"This is a true and legitimate representation of my intentions, and it has NEVER been tampered with!"
Availability:The fundamental security goal of ensuring that computer systems operate continuously and that authorized persons can access data that they need:"If I SHOULD be able to access it, I CAN access it!"
Non-repudiation:The security goal of ensuring that the party that sent a transmission or created data remains associated with that data and cannot deny sending or creating that data:"You can't deny you did anything on MY network!"
NIST:The organization that develops computer security standards and is used by US federal agencies and publishes cybersecurity best practice guides and research:The organization that develops computer security standards and is used by US federal agencies and publishes cybersecurity best practice guides and research
CSF:A collection of standards, best practices, and guidelines for effective security risk management. It can be general or cater to specific industries.:A framework that you use to enforce your cybersecurity policies
Security Controls:A technology or procedure put in place to mitigate vulnerabilities and risk and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information:A technology or procedure put in place to mitigate vulnerabilities and risk and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information
Gap analysis:A way to measure the difference between current and desired states of our security in order to help assess the scope of work included in a security project:The way to identify the window between our security procedures and how we are actually implementing those features
IAM:A security process that provides identification, authentication, and authorization mechanisms for entities that have access to our networks, systems, and applications:a program like Okta, Oracle, or SailPoint which monitors permissions within an organization.
Identification:The process by which a user account (and its credentials) is issued to the correct person. Sometimes referred to as enrollment:Provisioning; a user is provisioned proper access after the _____ process
Authentication:A method of validating a particular entity's or individual's unique credentials:"If you aren't able to get _____ you won't be able to get access!"
Accounting:Tracking authorized usage of a resource or use of rights by a subject and alerting when unauthorized use is detected or attempted:The process of logging actions encompassed by
AAA:A security concept where a centralized platform verifies subject identification, ensures the subject is assigned relevant permissions, and then logs these actions to create an audit trail:"Once we know who you are, you have to be allowed in, and once you're allowed in, we're always watching you"
Security Control:A technology or procedure put in place to mitigate vulnerabilities and risk and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information:Requiring MFA via company policy is an example of
Managerial Control:The control gives oversight of the information system. Examples could include risk identification or a tool allowing the evaluation and selection of other security controls:A security control that gives oversight
Operational Control:A category of security control that is implemented by people:Phishing awareness training
Technical Control:The control is implemented as a system to prevent breach:A control which uses things like firewalls and antivirus
Physical:A security control that physically prevents or physically notifies us of breaches:A control such as an alarm, a gateway, a lock, room lighting, a security camera, or a security guard
